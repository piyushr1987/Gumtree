Gumtree has always had community at its heart. Founded in 2000 by two friends,their aim was to build a community where people like them could find everything they needed to settle into a new city: a job, a place to live, and some furniture to fill their place. What they created was the first online classifieds platform in the UK – a space where people could come together to help each other out in small ways. 

Today, Gumtree remains one of the UK’s largest online classifieds sites serving communities up and down the UK, helping people find what they need most, affordably and locally. Gumtree provides a platform for people to connect around a life stage, a need, a pastime, passion or interest, from new parents trading buggies and nursery equipment, to bike enthusiasts, fuelling their passion. 

So whether it’s a buyer for that “thing” you no longer need, a new car to get you from A-B, a job, sofa or new flat, Gumtree makes Good Finds happen.
